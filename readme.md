# Comprehensive WordPress Plugin with Custom SQL, Caching, Security, and Modern Front-End using REST API, React, and Tailwind CSS
Objective: Develop a WordPress plugin for managing a library system that handles book records using custom SQL queries and a REST API. The plugin should demonstrate advanced PHP techniques, caching, security, adherence to coding standards, efficient database querying, and modern front-end development practices using React and Tailwind CSS.

## Requirements:
# 1. Database Setup:
Create a custom database table for storing book records. The table should include the following fields:

Book ID (Primary Key)
Title
Author
Publisher
ISBN
Publication Date
Create an activation hook in the plugin to set up the database table.

# 2. CRUD Operations:
Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for the book records using custom SQL queries. Ensure all operations are handled securely and efficiently.

# 3. Caching:
Use WordPress Transients API to cache the results of frequently accessed queries. Implement appropriate cache invalidation logic to ensure data consistency.

# 4. Security:
Implement nonces for all REST API requests. Validate and sanitize all user inputs. Use prepared statements for all custom SQL queries to prevent SQL injection.

# 5. Coding Standards:
Adhere to WordPress PHP coding standards. Use PHPDoc for inline comments and documentation. Implement a PHP trait for common functionality, such as sanitization and validation.

# 6. REST API:
Create custom REST API endpoints for managing the book records. Ensure the REST API is secure and follows best practices.

# 7. Search and Pagination:
Implement a search functionality to find books by title, author, or ISBN using custom SQL queries. Implement pagination for the search results.

# 8. Front-End Development:
Use React for building the front-end components. Use Tailwind CSS for styling the front-end components. Create a front-end interface with search functionality using the custom REST API. Bundle the front-end assets using Webpack.

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Database Design: Proper setup and use of custom database tables.
- CRUD Operations: Correct implementation and handling of custom SQL queries for CRUD operations.
- Performance: Efficiency of custom SQL queries and effectiveness of caching mechanisms.
- Security: Proper validation and sanitization of inputs, use of nonces, and overall security practices.
- Coding Standards: Adherence to WordPress coding standards, use of PHPDoc, and implementation of PHP traits.
- REST API: Proper implementation and security of custom REST API endpoints.
- Front-End: Use of React, Tailwind CSS, and Webpack, and functionality of search interface.
- Documentation: Clarity and completeness of the readme file and inline code comments.
